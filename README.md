# Calculator REST API

This is a project intended to practice app development with Python and Flask. Also it should be a reference.

## Quick start

Run the following command to spin up the server in foreground in port 8080:

```
docker-compose up
```


Also, if you want to develop/test locally you can create a virtual env and install the requirements.txt dependencies:

```
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    flask --app app/main --debug run -p 3000 
```
